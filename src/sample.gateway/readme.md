## Package References

The project should restore from publically available nuget feeds.  

## .NET Version

This project targets .NET 10.0 and C# 14.0. Ensure your development environment is set up accordingly.

## Caution

This sample code is provided "AS-IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind, express or implied. Use it at your own risk.

## Launch Profiles

The project includes launch profiles for different configurations. Use the Run and Debug pane (Ctrl+Shift+D) in Visual Studio and use the desired configuration.

## Available Commands

The commands below demonstrate how to interact with the Power Platform Licensing APIs.  To run these commands, ensure you have the necessary permissions (e.g., Tenant Admin) and that your environment is set up correctly.

To run these commands you have a few options:
1. Use the integrated terminal in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
1. Use any other terminal of your choice.

Running these commands will launch an authentication flow to acquire a user token for the specified tenant.  
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands.  
The command uses a launch profile named "ToolsDevelopment" which is pre-configured for production scenarios.

The examples below use a sample tenant id and environment id.  You should change these to your tenant id and environment id.  To find these details you can use PPAC (Power Platform Admin Center) or other tools.

Sample commands executed in the terminal `developer console`:

```terminal

#REM Get the Billing Policies
> dotnet run --launch-profile "ToolsDevelopment" "CommandBillingPoliciesGet" --tenantId 03ab3068-c403-406d-8351-bdbb6374c8b0 --project src/sample.gateway

#REM Get the environments associatd with the Billing Policy
